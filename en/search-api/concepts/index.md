# About {{ search-api-full-name }}

{{ search-api-full-name }} allows you to automatically send requests to the Yandex search database and get responses in XML format. The service is tailored for developers and webmasters.

With {{ search-api-name }}, you can easily implement the search feature on individual websites, groups of websites, or across the internet, or create an application with built-in search features. Additionally, it offers features to monitor website ranking for specific queries in Yandex search results.

{{ search-api }} supports [GET](get-request.md) and [POST](post-request.md) methods for sending search queries. They have the same [response format](response.md).

When [signing up](../operations/registration.md) in {{ search-api-name }}, you need to select one of three available types of search: Russian, Turkish, or international. The search type determines the search result _ranking formula_ and the _search database_, i.e., the documents that are searched through. Once signed up, you will be able to change the selected search type.

With {{ search-api-name }}, you can get default search results and those optimized for [mobile devices](../operations/mobile.md).
