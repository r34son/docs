# Access management in {{ cdn-name }}

{{ cdn-name }} uses [roles](../../iam/concepts/access-control/roles.md) to manage access rights.

In this section, you will learn:

* [Which resources you can assign a role for](#resources).
* [Which roles exist in the service](#roles-list).
* [Which roles are required](#required-roles) for particular actions.

## What roles do I need {#required-roles}

The table below lists the roles needed to perform a particular action. You can always assign a role granting more permissions than the role specified. For example, you can assign the `editor` role instead of the `viewer` one.
