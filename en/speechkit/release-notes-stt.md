### Release on March 2, 2022 {#020322}

The `general:rc` model has undergone further upgrades based on user data.

### Release on February 17, 2022 {#170222}

The current release improved the quality of the Russian-language `general:rc` model in the following areas:

1. Recognition of last and first names, patronymics, and addresses.
1. Recognition of customer-specific terms. The model was enhanced with data from a user request dated February 1, 2022, and corrected based on user data from November 9, 2021.
1. Punctuation in long sentences and texts with numbers.

### Release on February 3, 2022 {#030222}

1. In the `general:rc`, a universal mode (`"auto"` language) is available. In this mode, the model can recognize speech in one of the following languages:
   * Russian
   * Kazakh
   * English
   * German
   * French
   * Finnish
   * Swedish
   * Dutch
   * Polish
   * Portuguese
   * Italian
   * Spanish

1. New languages are also available under their own codes. The `general:rc` model uses indication as a hint for language recognition. If the language is indicated explicitly, the model will use it as a hint to improve the recognition quality. Currently, a hint only affects the quality of recognition of Russian.

When using `general:rc`, we recommend enabling [auto-tuning](stt/additional-training.md#autotuning).

_Known problems_: in universal mode, recognition quality may deteriorate in the case of continuous speech without pauses.

### Release on January 26, 2022 {#260122}

1. The `general` and `general:rc` recognition models for the Kazakh language are available in streaming and delayed recognition modes.

1. The `general:rc` model now supports a punctuator in streaming and delayed recognition modes.

1. In delayed recognition mode, you can now work with [MP3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MP3) format.
