# Resolutions

A resolution is an issue attribute that specifies why the issue was closed. For example, one can close an issue because it was completed (*{{ ui-key.startrek-backend.applinks.samsara.resolution.resolved }}*) or because it is a duplicate of another issue (*{{ ui-key.startrek-backend.applinks.samsara.resolution.duplicate }}*).

For each [issue type](./add-ticket-type.md) in a queue, you can define their own set of resolutions within a [workflow](./add-workflow.md). The queue owner and users granted [permission to access the queue settings](queue-access.md) can edit resolutions in queue workflows.

In {{ tracker-name }}, there are system resolutions that are listed in the [{{ tracker-name }} settings]({{ link-admin-resolutions }}). You can use these resolutions in any queues. If you do not find a suitable resolution among the system ones, a {{ tracker-name }} [administrator](../role-model.md) can create a new resolution. It will appear in the common resolution list and users will be able to use it in their queues.
