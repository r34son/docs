# Projects and portfolios. Overview

The Entities API presents a unified set of methods for project and portfolio management, more flexible and functional than the project management API.

With this API, you can:

- [Create](create-entity.md), [edit](update-entity.md), and [delete](delete-entity.md) projects and portfolios.
- [Get information](get-entity.md) about projects and portfolios.
- [Search](search-entities.md) for and [make bulk changes](bulkchange-entities.md) to projects and portfolios.
- [Create](./checklists/add-checklist.md), [edit](./checklists/patch-checklist.md), and [delete](./checklists/delete-checklist.md) checklists.
- [Edit](./checklists/patch-checklist-item.md), [move](./checklists/move-checklist-item.md), and [delete](./checklists/delete-checklist-item.md) individual checklist items.

## Request parameters {#query-params}

You can use request parameters to include additional information in the response body.
