# Creating a queue for the support team


1. If {{ tracker-name }} is not enabled for your organization yet, [connect the service](enable-tracker.md).

1. [Add users to {{ tracker-name }}](add-users.md).


1. [Create a queue](manager/create-queue.md) using the **Basic support** or **Multi-tiered support** template.

   These [templates](manager/workflows.md) already include preset issue types and statuses that can be helpful for managing user requests. The **Multi-tiered support** template includes the **Support line 1** and **Support line 2** issue statuses.

1. Add your support staff to the [queue team](manager/queue-team.md).

1. You can also configure access [rights to issues within the queue](manager/queue-access.md) if needed. For example, you can restrict certain groups of users from creating or viewing issues in your queue.
