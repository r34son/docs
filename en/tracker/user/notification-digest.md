# Receiving update reports

To get a recurrent report on the latest changes in the issues that you are subscribed to:

<!---1. {% include [open-personal-settings](../../_includes/tracker/open-personal-settings.md) %}-->

1. Click the link [{{ link-tracker }} settings]({{ link-settings }}).

1. Enable **Receive issue update digest** and choose how often you'd like to receive updates.

1. Click **Save**.

The report will include a list of issues that changed over the selected period. You can also [specify what changes](notification-settings.md) to include in the report.
