# Deleting an issue

You cannot delete an issue in {{ tracker-name }}. This operation is disabled for the convenience of your organization and employees. This makes sure the information about all issues remains in the database and can be fetched at any time. If you created an issue by mistake and want to cancel it because your plans have changed, close the issue with a proper resolution.

For example, you can close duplicate issues with the **{{ ui-key.startrek-backend.applinks.samsara.resolution.duplicate }}** resolution and use the **Canceled** resolution to close issues created by mistake. For more information about how to close issues, see [Working with issues](ticket-in-progress.md#section_kyj_gbm_2z).

You can also hide an unnecessary issue from search results and dashboards by clearing the **Assignee** field, deleting its links to other issues, and so on.


{% note tip %}

You can [delete a queue](../manager/delete-queue.md) and all the issues in it: [Move](move-ticket.md) the issues you do not need to a special queue and then delete it.
