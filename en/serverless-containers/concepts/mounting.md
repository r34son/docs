# Mounting a bucket to a container

{% include [read-note](../../_includes/functions/read-note.md) %}

Mounting buckets allows you to access them through the file system interface. In the container revision settings, the user can specify one or more mounting paths. Use this path to access the directory in which the bucket is mounted.

You can mount the entire bucket or a specific [folder](../../storage/concepts/object.md#folder).
