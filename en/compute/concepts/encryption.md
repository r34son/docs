# Encryption in {{ compute-name }}

By default, all data on {{ compute-name }} [disks](../../compute/concepts/disk.md) is encrypted at the storage database level using a system key. This protects your data from compromise in the event of physical disk theft from {{ yandex-cloud }} data centers. For more information, see [{#T}](../../security/standarts.md#sec-data).

We also recommend encrypting disks and [disk snapshots](../../compute/concepts/snapshot.md) using {{ kms-full-name }} custom [symmetric keys](../../kms/concepts/key.md). This approach allows you to:
* Protect yourself against potential threats of isolation breach and data compromise at the virtual infrastructure level.
* Control the encryption and lifecycle of {{ kms-short-name }} keys and manage the keys, see [{#T}](../../kms/operations/key.md).
* Put the data on your disk under improved access control by setting permissions for {{ kms-short-name }} keys, see [{#T}](../../kms/operations/key-access.md).
* Track encryption and decryption operations performed using your {{ kms-short-name }} key with the help of {{ at-full-name }}, see [Key usage audit](../../kms/concepts/#keys-audit).


{% include [encryption-preview-note](../../_includes/compute/encryption-preview-note.md) %}

You can encrypt the following types of disks:
* Network SSD (`network-ssd`)
* Network HDD (`network-hdd`)
* Non-replicated SSD (`network-ssd-nonreplicated`)
* High-performance SSD (`network-ssd-io-m3`)

For more details, see [Disk types](disk.md#disks-types).

In {{ compute-name }}, encryption is available from the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}).

## Encryption options {#encryption-options}

The options available when creating encrypted {{ compute-name }} resources and some aspects of using {{ kms-short-name }} keys are presented in the table:

| **Target resource** | **Source resource** | **Key** | **Note** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Empty encrypted disk | N/A | Any | See [{#T}](../operations/disk-create/empty.md). |
| Encrypted disk | Unencrypted image | Any | See [{#T}](../operations/disk-create/from-image.md). </br>You can also use an image to</br>encrypt existing [disks](../operations/disk-control/disk-encrypt.md) and [snapshots](../operations/snapshot-control/snapshot-encrypt.md). |
| Encrypted disk | Encrypted snapshot | Snapshot key | See [{#T}](../operations/disk-create/from-snapshot.md). |
| Encrypted snapshot | Encrypted disk | Disk key | See [{#T}](../operations/disk-control/create-snapshot.md). |

The following additional encryption options will be implemented in {{ compute-name }} later:

| **Target resource** | **Source resource** | **Key** | **Note** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Encrypted disk | Encrypted image | Image key | See [{#T}](../operations/disk-create/from-image.md).</br>You can also use an encrypted</br>image to create a copy of</br>an encrypted disk. |
| Encrypted disk | Unencrypted snapshot | Any | See [{#T}](../operations/disk-create/from-snapshot.md). |
| Encrypted image | Encrypted disk | Disk key | See [{#T}](../operations/image-create/create-from-disk.md). |

## Using custom keys {#user-keys}

By using custom {{ kms-short-name }} keys for disk and snapshot encryption, you can achieve more granular control over access to encrypted data: create custom keys for specific users or tasks, timely deactivate or delete specific keys.

{% include [encryption-keys-note](../../_includes/compute/encryption-keys-note.md) %}

For a VM to have access to an encrypted disk, attach to it a [service account](../../iam/concepts/users/service-accounts.md) with the `kms.keys.encrypterDecrypter` [role](../../kms/security/index.md#kms-keys-encrypterDecrypter). Note that you can attach two types of service accounts to a VM:
* Service account to [work with cloud resources](../operations/vm-connect/auth-inside-vm) from inside the VM, e.g., to deliver metrics to {{ monitoring-full-name }}, send logs to {{ cloud-logging-full-name }}, or connect to {{ backup-full-name }}. This service account is specified in the access parameter section.
* Service account to access encrypted disks. This service account is specified in the disk parameter section.

To use encryption in {{ compute-name }}, the user must have the following roles:
* `iam.serviceAccounts.user` or a higher role for the service account used for encryption. For more information, see [{{ iam-full-name }} roles](../../iam/security/index.md#iam-serviceAccounts-user).
* `kms.viewer` or a higher role for the key used for encryption. For more information, see [{{ kms-full-name }} roles](../../kms/security/index.md#kms-viewer).
