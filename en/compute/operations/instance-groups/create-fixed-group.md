# Creating a fixed-size instance group

You can create a group with a fixed number of instances. The size of this [instance group](../../concepts/instance-groups/index.md) is set manually. For more information, see [{#T}](../../concepts/instance-groups/scale.md#fixed-scale).

{% include [warning.md](../../../_includes/instance-groups/warning.md) %}

{% include [sa.md](../../../_includes/instance-groups/sa.md) %}

{% include [password-reset-note](../../../_includes/compute/password-reset-note.md) %}

To create a fixed-size instance group:

{% list tabs group=instructions %}

- Management console {#console}

   {% include [create-fixed-group-via-concole.md](../../../_includes/instance-groups/create-fixed-group-via-concole.md) %}

- CLI {#cli}

   {% include [cli-install.md](../../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

   {% include [default-catalogue.md](../../../_includes/default-catalogue.md) %}

   1. View a description of the CLI command to create an instance group:

      ```bash
      {{ yc-compute-ig }} create --help
      ```

   1. Check if there are any [networks](../../../vpc/concepts/network.md#network) in the [folder](../../../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md#folder):

      ```bash
      yc vpc network list
      ```

      If there are none, [create a network](../../../vpc/operations/network-create.md).
   1. Select one of the {{ marketplace-full-name }} public images, e.g., [CentOS 7](/marketplace/products/yc/centos-7).

      {% include [standard-images.md](../../../_includes/standard-images.md) %}

   1. Create a YAML file with any name, e.g., `specification.yaml`.
   1. In the created file, indicate the following:
      * General information about the instance group:

         ```yaml
         name: first-fixed-group
         service_account_id: <service_account_ID>
         description: "This instance group was created from YAML config."
         ```

         Where:
         * `name`: Name of the instance group. The name must be unique within the folder. The name may contain lowercase Latin letters, numbers, and hyphens. The first character must be a letter. The last character cannot be a hyphen. The name may be up to 63 characters long.
         * `service_account_id`: Service account ID.

            {% include [sa-dependence-brief](../../../_includes/instance-groups/sa-dependence-brief.md) %}

         * `description`: Description of the instance group.
      * [Instance template](../../concepts/instance-groups/instance-template.md), such as:

         ```yaml
         instance_template:
           platform_id: standard-v3
           resources_spec:
             memory: 2g
             cores: 2
           boot_disk_spec:
             mode: READ_WRITE

           placement_policy:
             placement_group_id: rmppvhrgm77g********
         ```

         {% include [default-unit-size](../../../_includes/instance-groups/default-unit-size.md) %}

         * `size`: Disk size.
         * `network_id`: ID of the `default-net` network.
         * `primary_v4_address_spec`: IPv4 specification. You can allow public access to the group's instances by specifying the IP version for the [public IP address](../../../vpc/concepts/address.md#public-addresses). For more information, see [{#T}](../../concepts/instance-groups/instance-template.md#instance-template).
         * `security_group_ids`: List of [security group](../../../vpc/concepts/security-groups.md) IDs.

           * `false` (default): Create a regular VM.

           When creating a preemptible instance group, keep in mind that the VM instances will terminate after 24 hours of continuous operation or earlier. {{ ig-name }} may not be able to restart them immediately due to insufficient resources. This may occur in the event of a sharp increase in the use of {{ yandex-cloud }} computing resources.

   1. Create an instance group in the default folder:

      ```bash
      {{ yc-compute-ig }} create --file specification.yaml
      ```

      This command creates a group of three similar instances with the following configuration:
      * Name: `first-fixed-group`
      * OS: CentOS 7
      * Network: `default-net`
      * Availability zone: `{{ region-id }}-a`
      * vCPUs: 2; RAM: 2 GB
      * Network HDD: 32 GB

      For more information about resources you can create with {{ TF }}, see the [provider documentation]({{ tf-provider-link }}/).
   1. Create resources:

      {% include [terraform-validate-plan-apply](../../../_tutorials/terraform-validate-plan-apply.md) %}

      All the resources you need will then be created in the specified folder. You can check the new resources and their configuration using the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}).
