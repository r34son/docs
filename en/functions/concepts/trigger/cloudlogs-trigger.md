# Trigger for {{ cloud-logs-name }}

{% note alert %}

Trigger for {{ cloud-logs-name }} is outdated. Use [triggers for {{ cloud-logging-name }}](./cloud-logging-trigger.md).

{% endnote %}

A trigger for {{ cloud-logs-name }} runs a function when messages are received in a log group. The trigger must be in the same folder as the log groups to which it is subscribed.

{% note alert %}

Triggers for {{ cloud-logs-name }} may skip messages under increased load. To make sure you do not lose them, in the trigger settings for {{ cloud-logs-name }}, specify [DLQ](../dlq.md) and process messages from there with a [trigger for {{ message-queue-short-name }}](ymq-trigger.md).

{% endnote %}

A trigger for {{ cloud-logs-name }} needs a [service account](../../../iam/concepts/users/service-accounts.md) to call the function.

For more information about creating a trigger for {{ cloud-logs-name }}, see [{#T}](../../operations/trigger/cloudlogs-trigger-create.md).

## Batching {#batching}

Batching settings allow you to send multiple messages to a function at the same time. They set a top limit on a message batch size and its accumulation time. For example, if the message batch size is 3, the function can receive batches containing from 1 to 3 messages.

## Roles required for the proper operation of a trigger for {{ cloud-logs-name }} {#roles}

- To create a trigger, you need a permission for a service account that runs the trigger executing the operation. This permission is included in the [iam.serviceAccounts.user](../../../iam/security/index.md#iam-serviceAccounts-user) and [{{ roles-editor }}](../../../iam/roles-reference.md#editor) roles and higher.
- For the trigger to fire, the service account needs the `{{ roles-functions-invoker }}` role for the folder containing the function called by the trigger.

Read more about [access management](../../security/index.md).

## {{ cloud-logs-name }} trigger message format {#ymq-format}
