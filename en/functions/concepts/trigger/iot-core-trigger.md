# Trigger for {{ iot-short-name }} that sends messages to the {{ sf-name }} function

A [trigger](../trigger/) for {{ iot-short-name }} manages messages exchanged between devices, registries, and brokers. You create this trigger for topics: it receives copies of messages from topics and sends those to the {{ sf-name }} function for processing.

{% include [trigger](../../../_includes/iot-core/trigger.md) %}

A trigger for {{ iot-short-name }} needs a [service account](../../../iam/concepts/users/service-accounts.md) to call the function.

## Roles required for the proper operation of a trigger for {{ iot-short-name }} {#roles}

* To create a trigger, you need a permission for a service account that runs the trigger executing the operation. This permission is included in the [iam.serviceAccounts.user](../../../iam/security/index.md#iam-serviceAccounts-user) and [{{ roles-editor }}](../../../iam/roles-reference.md#editor) roles and higher.
* For the trigger to fire, the service account needs the `{{ roles-functions-invoker }}` role for the folder containing the function called by the trigger.

Read more about [access management](../../security/index.md).
