# Resource relationships in {{ mrd-name }}

{{ RD }} is a high-performance DBMS for storing key-value data that runs in RAM. {{ mrd-name }} allows you to easily create {{ RD }} host clusters with a high level of fault tolerance.

The main entity used in {{ mrd-name }} is a _database cluster_.

Each cluster consists of one or more _database hosts_, which are virtual machines with DBMS servers deployed on them. Cluster hosts may reside in different availability zones and even different availability regions. You can learn more about {{ yandex-cloud }} availability zones [here](../../overview/concepts/geo-scope.md).

* A cluster consisting of three or more hosts supports automatic failover, as each host can take the cluster's primary replica role.

* A cluster of one or two hosts is cheaper, but it does not guarantee fault tolerance.

When creating a cluster, specify:
* _Host class_: VM template for deploying the cluster hosts. For a list of available host classes and their specs, see [{#T}](instance-types.md).

* _Environment_: Environment where the cluster will be deployed:
   * `PRODUCTION`: For stable versions of your apps.
   * `PRESTABLE`: For testing purposes. The prestable environment is similar to the production environment and likewise covered by the SLA, but it is the first to get new functionalities, improvements, and bug fixes. In the prestable environment, you can test compatibility of new versions with your application.

{% note info %}

The amount of memory allocated to a host is also determined by the `maxmemory` configuration parameter for Redis hosts; the maximum amount of data is 75% of the available memory. For example, for a host class with 8 GB RAM, the `maxmemory` value will be 6 GB.

A cluster created in a folder can be accessed by all VMs connected to the same cloud network. For more information about networking, see the [{{ vpc-name }} documentation](../../vpc/).
