The `viewer` role grants permission to read resources.

The `viewer` role includes all permissions granted by the `auditor` role. Unlike `auditor`, the `viewer` role allows access to service data in read mode.

For example, the `viewer` role allows you to perform the following operations:
* View information about a resource.
* Get a list of nested resources, such as a list of VMs in a folder.
* View a list of operations with a resource.
