The `managed-airflow.editor` role allows you to manage the Apache Airflow™ clusters, as well as get information about quotas and service resource operations.

Users with this role can:
* View information about the [Apache Airflow™ clusters](../../managed-airflow/concepts/index.md#cluster), as well as create, modify, and delete them.
* Use the web interface to access the [Apache Airflow™ components](../../managed-airflow/concepts/index.md#components).

It includes the permissions of the `managed-airflow.viewer` role.

To create Apache Airflow™ clusters, you also need the `vpc.user` role.
