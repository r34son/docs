The `storage.uploader` role enables you to upload [objects](../../storage/concepts/object.md) to a bucket and overwrite previously uploaded ones. Since the `storage.uploader` role inherits the permissions of the `storage.viewer` role, it also grants permission to list [bucket](../../storage/concepts/bucket.md) objects and download them.

This role does not allow you to delete objects or configure buckets.
