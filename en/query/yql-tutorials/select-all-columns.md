# Selecting data from all columns

To select data from all columns, use the SELECT statement:

```sql
SELECT  -- Data selection operator.
    *   -- Select all columns.
FROM
    `tutorial-analytics`
```

Take a look at the block on the right and click ![run](../../_assets/console-icons/play-fill.svg) **Run**.
