You can assign roles to a service account for any resources in any cloud if these resources belong to the same organization as the service account. You can also assign roles to a service account for the organization.

## Assigning a role for a resource {#binding-role-resource}

Access rights will be inherited by child resources from their parent resources. For example, if a service account is assigned a role for a cloud, the service account will be granted the appropriate permissions to all resources in all folders of this cloud.

- Management console {#console}

   You assign roles to a service account the same way as to a user account.

   To assign a service account a role for a cloud or folder:

   1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), select the appropriate cloud or folder.
   1. Go to the **{{ ui-key.yacloud.common.resource-acl.label_access-bindings }}** tab.
   1. Click **{{ ui-key.yacloud.common.resource-acl.button_new-bindings }}**.
   1. In the window that opens, click ![image](../../_assets/console-icons/plus.svg) **{{ ui-key.yacloud_components.acl.action.select-subject }}** → **{{ ui-key.yacloud.common.resource-acl.label_service-accounts }}**.
   1. Select the required service account from the list or use the search.
   1. Click ![image](../../_assets/console-icons/plus.svg) **{{ ui-key.yacloud_components.acl.button.add-role }}**.
   1. Select a role in the folder.
   1. Click **{{ ui-key.yacloud_components.acl.action.apply }}**.

- CLI {#cli}

   {% include [cli-install](../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

   {% include [default-catalogue](../default-catalogue.md) %}

   To assign a service account a role for a cloud or folder, run this command:

   ```bash
   yc resource-manager <resource_category> add-access-binding <resource_name_or_ID> \
     --role <role_ID> \
     --subject serviceAccount:<service_account_ID>
   ```

   Where:

   * `<resource_category>`: `Cloud` to assign a cloud role, or `folder` to assign a folder role.
   * `<resource_name_or_ID>`: Name or ID of the resource the role is assigned for.
   * `--role`: Role ID, e.g., `{{ roles-viewer }}`.
   * `--subject serviceAccount`: ID of the service account which is being assigned the role.

   For example, to assign a service account the `{{ roles-viewer }}` role for the `my-folder` [folder](../../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md#folder):

- {{ TF }} {#tf}

   {% include [terraform-install](../../_includes/terraform-install.md) %}

   1. In the configuration file, describe the parameters of the resources you want to create:

      Here is an example of the configuration file structure:

      ```
      resource "yandex_resourcemanager_folder_iam_member" "admin-account-iam" {
        folder_id   = "<folder_ID>"
        role        = "<role>"
        member      = "serviceAccount:<service_account_ID>"
      }
      ```

      Where:
      * `folder_id`: [Folder ID](../../resource-manager/operations/folder/get-id.md). This is a required parameter.
      * `role`: Role being assigned. You can find the description of the roles in the {{ iam-full-name }} documentation in the [{{ yandex-cloud }} role reference](../../iam/roles-reference.md). This is a required parameter.
      * `member`: [ID](../../iam/operations/sa/get-id.md) of the service account the role is assigned to. It should be specified in `serviceAccount:<service_account_ID>` format. This is a required parameter.

      For more information about resources you can create with {{ TF }}, see the [provider documentation]({{ tf-provider-link }}/).

   1. Make sure the configuration files are valid.

      1. In the command line, go to the directory where you created the configuration file.
      1. Run a check using this command:

         ```
         terraform plan
         ```

      If the configuration is described correctly, the terminal will display a list of created resources and their parameters. If the configuration contains any errors, {{ TF }} will point them out.

   1. Deploy cloud resources.

      1. If the configuration does not contain any errors, run this command:

         ```
         terraform apply
         ```

      1. Confirm creating the resources: type `yes` in the terminal and press **Enter**.

      All the resources you need will then be created in the specified folder. You can check the new resource using the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}) or this [CLI](../../cli/quickstart.md) command:

      ```bash
      yc resource-manager folder list-access-bindings <folder_name_or_ID>
      ```

## Assigning a role for an organization {#binding-role-organization}

Access rights are inherited from an organization by all resources created in the organization. For example, if a service account is assigned a role for an organization, the service account will be granted the appropriate permissions to all resources in all clouds of this organization.

To grant a service account access rights to an organization, you need the `{{ roles-organization-admin }}` role or higher.

      If the service account is not on the list, click **{{ ui-key.yacloud_org.entity.user.action.acl }}** in the top-right corner. In the window that opens, click ![image](../../_assets/console-icons/plus.svg) **{{ ui-key.yacloud_components.acl.action.select-subject }}** → **{{ ui-key.yacloud.common.resource-acl.label_service-accounts }}** and select the appropriate account from the list or use the search bar.

   1. Click ![image](../../_assets/console-icons/plus.svg) **{{ ui-key.yacloud_components.acl.button.add-role }}** and enter the role name or select one from the list.

      You can find the description of the available roles in the {{ iam-full-name }} documentation in the [{{ yandex-cloud }} role reference](../../iam/roles-reference.md).

   1. Click **{{ ui-key.yacloud_components.acl.action.apply }}**.

- CLI {#cli}

   {% include [cli-install](../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

   {% include [default-catalogue](../default-catalogue.md) %}

   To assign a service account a role for an organization, run this command:

   ```bash
   yc organization-manager organization add-access-binding <organization_name_or_ID> \
     --role <role_ID> \
     --subject serviceAccount:<service_account_ID>
   ```

   Where:
   * `<organization_name_or_ID>`: Technical name or ID of the organization.
   * `--role`: Role ID, e.g., `{{ roles-viewer }}`.
   * `--subject serviceAccount`: ID of the service account which is being assigned the role.

   For example, to assign a service account the `{{ roles-viewer }}` role for the `MyOrg` organization:

   1. Select a role to assign to the service account. You can find the description of the roles in the {{ iam-full-name }} documentation in the [{{ yandex-cloud }} role reference](../../iam/roles-reference.md).

   1. Get a list of available organizations to find out their IDs and technical names:

      ```bash
      yc organization-manager organization list
      ```

      Result:

      ```bash
      +---------------------------------+---------------------------------+----------------------+
      |               ID                |              NAME               |        TITLE         |

      +---------------------------------+---------------------------------+----------------------+
      ```

      The organization's technical name is in the `NAME` column and its ID is in the `ID` column.

   1. Find out the service account ID by its name:

      ```bash
      yc iam service-account get my-robot
      ```

      Result:

      ```bash
      id: aje6o61dvog2********
      folder_id: b1gvmob95yys********
      created_at: "2018-10-15T18:01:25Z"
      name: my-robot
      ```

      If you do not know the name of the service account, get a complete list of service accounts with their IDs:

      ```bash
      yc iam service-account list
      ```

      Result:

      ```bash
      +----------------------+------------------+-----------------+
      |          ID          |       NAME       |   DESCRIPTION   |
      +----------------------+------------------+-----------------+
      | aje6o61dvog2******** | my-robot         | my description  |
      +----------------------+------------------+-----------------+
      ```

   1. Assign the `my-robot` service account the `{{ roles-viewer }}` role for an organization with the `bpf1smsil5q0********` ID:

      ```bash
      yc organization-manager organization add-access-binding bpf1smsil5q0******** \
        --role viewer \
        --subject serviceAccount:aje6o61dvog2********
      ```

      }
      ```

      Where:
      * `organization_id`: [Organization ID](../../organization/operations/org-profile.md). This is a required parameter.
      * `role`: Role being assigned. You can find the description of the roles in the {{ iam-full-name }} documentation in the [{{ yandex-cloud }} role reference](../../iam/roles-reference.md). For each role, you can only use one `yandex_organization manager_organization_iam_binding`. This is a required parameter.
      * `members`: [ID](../../iam/operations/sa/get-id.md) of the service account the role is being assigned to. It should be specified in `serviceAccount:<service_account_ID>` format. This is a required parameter.

      }
      ```

   1. Create the request body, for example, in the `body.json` file. Set the `action` property to `ADD` and the `roleId` property to the appropriate role, such as `{{ roles-viewer }}`, and specify the `serviceAccount` type and service account ID in the `subject` property:

      **body.json:**

      ```json
      {
        "accessBindingDeltas": [{
          "action": "ADD",
          "accessBinding": {
