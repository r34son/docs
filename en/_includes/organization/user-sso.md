## Federated users {#user-sso}

If you did not enable the **Automatically create users** option when [setting up a federation](../../organization/concepts/add-federation.md#federation-usage), you will have to add federated users to your organization manually.

To do this, you need to know the user name IDs returned by the Identity Provider (IdP) server together with the successful authentication response. This will usually be the user's email address. To find out what the server returns as the name ID, contact the administrator who configured authentication for your federation.

{% include [auto-create-users](../../_includes/organization/auto-create-users.md) %}

You do not need to invite federated users to the organization; they are added automatically after logging in.
