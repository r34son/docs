#### Folder ID and API key {#user-key}

The `folderid` field contains the [folder ID](../../resource-manager/operations/folder/get-id.md) of the service account you will use to send requests. You will need it for user authentication together with the `apikey` parameter (the service account's [API key](../../iam/concepts/authorization/api-key.md)).
