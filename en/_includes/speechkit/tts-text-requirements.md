* When recording Russian speech, make sure to use the letter _ё_ when needed in the pattern text. You cannot use _е_ instead of _ё_ in any synthesized text. In homographs where the stress may be ambiguous, explicitly indicate the stressed vowel with the `+` sign.
   > _The +import of goods from foreign countries._: Stress falls on the first syllable.
   > _Goods they im+port from China._: Stress falls on the second syllable.

* The lines of text for synthesis cannot include numbers or abbreviations, such as _15 Smith st., bl. 3_ or _USD 13.10_. Make sure to spell out all numbers and abbreviations.
   > Fifteen Smith street, block three.
   > Thirteen dollars and ten cents.

* In questions, specify which word should be \*\*logically stressed\*\* to indicate the intonation of an interrogative sentence.

   > The sentence _Did the cat go to the forest?_ can be read in three different ways:
   > * Did the \*\*cat\*\* go to the forest? Meaning _Who went to the forest? Was it really the cat?_
   > * Did the cat \*\*go\*\* to the forest? Meaning _Did the cat walk or run?_ or _Was the action performed? Is the cat gone or not?_
   > * Did the cat go \*\*to the forest\*\*? Meaning _Where did the cat go and why? To the forest, outside, to look for a sausage?_
   >
   > In all sentences, the logical stress emphasizes the main meaning of the sentence.
