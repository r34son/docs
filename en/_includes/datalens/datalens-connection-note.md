When connecting an external database which is not a {{ yandex-cloud }} resource:

* Make sure that the database uses an SSL certificate signed by a SSL certificate authority. You will not be able to create a connection in {{ datalens-short-name }} if the database uses a self-signed SSL certificate.
* Grant database access to the following {{ datalens-short-name }} IP ranges (`/` is followed by subnet mask length):

  {% list tabs group=ip_address %}

  - ipv4 {#ipv4}

    * `178.154.242.176/28`
