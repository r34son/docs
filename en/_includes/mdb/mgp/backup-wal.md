The total backup size is a whole of data copy and WAL sizes. The backup size does not include the amount of deduplicated append-optimized table data. The size of WAL data depends on the amount of made changes and is comparable to the backup size. You can get both values with a [list of backups](../../../managed-greenplum/operations/cluster-backups.md#list-backups).
