{% note warning %}

The SQL editor built into the management console is designed forÂ a narrow range of data editing tasks. Some parameter values can be replaced by the editor's defaults.

For working with databases, we recommend third-party editors or [{{ websql-full-name }}](../../../websql/concepts/index.md). To use {{ websql-full-name }}, click **Open** on a promo banner and [connect to a DB cluster](../../../websql/operations/connect.md#connect-cluster).
