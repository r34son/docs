On a chart, you can configure the shift logic for dependent and parent issues, as well as issue link display.

Above the timeline on the right, click ![](../../_assets/tracker/svg/gantt-settings-button.svg)&nbsp;**{{ ui-key.startrek.ui_components_Gantt.timeline-config }}** and select a setting in **Issue bar**:

* To have issues with the _Depends on â€” Blocks_ link joined with an arrow on the chart, select **{{ ui-key.startrek.ui_components_Gantt.show-links }}**.

* To automatically move the deadline of the dependent issue when the blocking issue's deadline changes, select the appropriate option.

* To extend the deadline of the parent issue depending on its sub-issues' deadlines, select the appropriate setting.
