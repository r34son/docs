Links between issues are shown as arrows from the dependent to the blocking issue if all of the following conditions are met:

1. There is a start date and deadline for both tasks.
1. There is a _Depends on – Blocks_ link configured.

* To add a _Depends on – Blocks_ [link](../../tracker/user/links.md), hover over the blocking issue bar so that the dots appear to the right and left of the bar.

   * To make the selected issue dependent, click the dot on the left and drag it to the blocking issue.

   * To make the selected issue blocking, click the dot on the right and drag it to the dependent issue.

   {% note info %}

   If the dependent issue deadline is earlier than that of the blocking issue, the arrow is red. You can enable [automatic update of start dates and deadlines](#timing) for dependent issues.

   {% endnote %}

* To delete a link between issues, click the link arrow and then click ![](../../_assets/tracker/svg/del-link.svg) **Delete link**.
