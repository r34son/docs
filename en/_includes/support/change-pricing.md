If an organization with an active support plan uses resources paid from different billing accounts, the percentage portion of the plan will be charged to each one of them based on the cost of consumed resources, while the fixed portion will be charged only to the account specified for the purpose when selecting the **{{ ui-key.support-center.tariff-plans.tariff-card.title_business }}** plan. When you change your plan, you can choose the billing account to be used to cover the fixed portion of the plan. This option is only available to the organization owner.
