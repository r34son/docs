You cannot tune the {{ yagpt-name }} model with new information, e.g., a support service knowledge base. However, you can train the model to generate responses in a specific format or analyze texts. You can train the model to:
* Summarize and rewrite texts.
* Generate questions and answers from text input.
* Provide responses in a particular format or style.
* Classify texts, forms of address, and dialogs.
* Extract data from texts.

If you want to fine-tune the model for other capabilities, contact our [support team]({{ link-console-support }}) to learn about custom model training.
