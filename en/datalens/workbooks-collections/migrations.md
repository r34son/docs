# Migrating objects to workbooks

{% note info %}

To migrate objects, a user must have the `{{ roles-datalens-admin }}` role.

{% endnote %}

You can select any object ([connection](../concepts/connection.md), [dataset](../concepts/dataset/index.md), [chart](../concepts/chart/index.md), [dashboard](../concepts/dashboard.md)) for migration and perform it by [transferring](#migration-transfer) or [copying](#migration-copy).

## Migration by transfer {#migration-transfer}

When this migration type is selected, the object is transferred to the [workbook](./index.md) along with all related objects:

* Original objects are not saved in the folder.
* Object IDs remain the same.
* Links to objects do not change and lead to the workbook.

During migration, {{ datalens-short-name }} finds linked objects recursively across all links. This enables you to start migration from any object. For example, you can do it from a dashboard. {{ datalens-short-name }} will find all linked charts, datasets, and connections. Then, it will perform a search for links for the objects it has found. Once finished, the service will prompt you to place all found objects in a workbook.

{% note warning %}

* Objects within a workbook cannot be migrated back to a folder.
* Immediately after the migration, all access rights to the transferred objects are revoked, and you become a sole [administrator](../security/roles.md#workbooks-admin) of the workbook who can assign [access rights](./security.md) to other users and user groups.

{% endnote %}

## Migration by copying {#migration-copy}

If the original object is to be saved in a folder, it can be copied to a workbook along with its linked objects:

* Original objects remain saved in the folder.
* New IDs are generated for the copied objects.
* Links to objects do not change.

You can start copying from any object. Unlike in a transfer, linked objects are searched down the [hierarchy](../concepts/index.md#component-interrelation), starting from the dashboard:

* Charts residing on the dashboard and the datasets and connections they are linked with are copied with the dashboard.
* Dataset and the connection to which it is linked are copied with the chart.
* Connection on which it is built is copied with the dataset.
* Connection is copied separately.

{{ datalens-short-name }} will suggest placing the objects it finds into a single workbook.

{% note warning %}

Copying the [Files](../operations/connection/create-file.md) and [Google Sheets](../operations/connection/create-google-sheets.md) connections is not available.

{% endnote %}

## How to migrate to a workbook {#migration-operation}

To copy or transfer an object to a workbook:

1. Find the object you want to transfer or copy to a workbook on the [navigation page](https://datalens.yandex.ru/navigation).
1. Click ![image](../../_assets/console-icons/ellipsis.svg) next to the object and select ![image](../../_assets/console-icons/arrow-uturn-cw-right.svg) **Migrating to a workbook**.
1. Select a migration method and click **Select**.
1. In the window with a list of linked objects, click **Next**.
1. In the window that opens, select the workbook to which you want to transfer or copy objects and click **Move**. To transfer or copy objects to a new workbook, click **Create a workbook**.
1. In the **Manage access** window, configure [workbook permissions](./security.md) and click **Close**.

## Copying a workbook {#copy-workbook}

If after migration you want your workbook to include only certain transferred objects, you can create a copy of the workbook and clear it of all unwanted objects.

Let's create a workbook with a dataset. For source objects, we will use a [ready-made dataset]({{ link-datalens-main }}/marketplace/f2e0000r63qkp2ywqpco) of a fictional company from the {{ datalens-short-name }} {{ marketplace-short-name }}.

1. On the [navigation page](https://datalens.yandex.ru/navigation), find **Sample Superstore Dataset**.
1. Click ![image](../../_assets/console-icons/ellipsis.svg) next to the dataset and select ![image](../../_assets/console-icons/arrow-uturn-cw-right.svg) **Transfer to workbook**.
1. In the window that opens, you will see a list of linked objects that will be transferred.

1. Click **Transfer**.
1. In the window that opens, click **Create a workbook**. Enter a name, such as **Sample Superstore All**, then click **Create**. Select the new workbook in the **Collections and workbooks** list and click **Move**.
1. In the **Manage access** window, configure [workbook permissions](./security.md) and click **Close**.

   After the migration, the **Sample Superstore All** workbook with the transferred dataset and linked objects will open.

1. Create a copy of your workbook:

   1. In the top-right corner of the workbook page, click **Copy**.
   1. In the window that opens, select the target collection and click **Copy**. To copy the workbook to a new collection, click **Create collection**.
   1. Enter a name for the new workbook, such as **Sample Superstore Copy**, then click **Copy**.

1. In the **Sample Superstore Copy** workbook, go to the **All objects** tab and delete everything except **Sample Superstore Connection** and **Sample Superstore Dataset**. To do this, click ![image](../../_assets/console-icons/ellipsis.svg) next to each object and select **Delete**.

Now your **Sample Superstore Copy** only contains **Sample Superstore Connection** and **Sample Superstore Dataset**. You can create charts and a dashboard in the workbook.
