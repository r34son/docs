To perform operations via the API, you need to get an [IAM token](../../iam/concepts/authorization/iam-token.md):

* [How to get a token](../../iam/operations/iam-token/create.md) for a Yandex account.
* [How to get a token](../../iam/operations/iam-token/create-for-sa.md) for a service account.
* [How to get a token](../../iam/operations/iam-token/create-for-federation.md) for a federated account.
