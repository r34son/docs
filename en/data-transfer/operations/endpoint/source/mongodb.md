# Transferring data from a {{ MG }} source endpoint

{{ data-transfer-full-name }} enables you to migrate data from a {{ MG }} database and implement various scenarios of data transfer, processing and transformation. To implement a transfer:

1. [Explore possible data transfer scenarios](#scenarios).
1. [Prepare the {{ MG }}](#prepare) database for the transfer.
1. [Set up an endpoint source](#endpoint-settings) in {{ data-transfer-full-name }}.
1. [Set up one of the supported data targets](#supported-targets).
1. [Create](../../transfer.md#create) a transfer and [start](../../transfer.md#activate) it.
1. [Perform required operations with the database](#db-actions) and [control the transfer](../../monitoring.md).
1. In case of any issues, [use ready-made solutions](#troubleshooting) to resolve them.

## Scenarios for transferring data from {{ MG }} {#scenarios}

1. {% include [migration](../../../../_includes/data-transfer/scenario-captions/migration.md) %}

   * [Migrating the {{ MG }} cluster](../../../tutorials/managed-mongodb.md).

1. {% include [storage](../../../../_includes/data-transfer/scenario-captions/storage.md) %}

For a detailed description of possible {{ data-transfer-full-name }} data transfer scenarios, see [Tutorials](../../../tutorials/index.md).

## Preparing the source database {#prepare}

{% include [prepare db](../../../../_includes/data-transfer/endpoints/sources/mongodb-prepare.md) %}

## Configuring the {{ MG }} source endpoint {#endpoint-settings}

{% include [MongodDB Verstion](../../../../_includes/data-transfer/notes/mongodb-version.md) %}

When [creating](../index.md#create) or [editing](../index.md#update) an endpoint, you can define:

* [{{ mmg-full-name }} cluster](#managed-service) connection or [custom installation](#on-premise) settings, including those based on {{ compute-full-name }} VMs. These are required parameters.
* [Additional parameters](#additional-settings).


### {{ mmg-name }} cluster {#managed-service}


{% note warning %}

To create or edit an endpoint of a managed database, you need to have the [`{{ roles.mmg.viewer }}` role](../../../../managed-mongodb/security/index.md#mmg-viewer) or the [`viewer` primitive role](../../../../iam/roles-reference.md#viewer) assigned for the folder where this managed database cluster resides.

{% endnote %}


Connecting to the database with the cluster ID specified in {{ yandex-cloud }}.

The settings are given for the OnPremise use case when all fields are filled in manually.

   Here is an example of the configuration file structure:

   
   ```hcl

### Collection filter {#additional-settings}

{% list tabs group=instructions %}

- Management console {#console}

   * **{{ ui-key.yc-data-transfer.data-transfer.console.form.mongo.console.form.mongo.MongoCollectionFilter.collections.title }}**: Data is only transferred from listed collections. All collections are transferred by default.

      {% include [Description for Included collections](../../../../_includes/data-transfer/fields/mongodb/description-included-collections.md) %}

   * **{{ ui-key.yc-data-transfer.data-transfer.console.form.mongo.console.form.mongo.MongoCollectionFilter.excluded_collections.title }}**: Data is transferred from all collections except the specified ones.

- {{ TF }} {#tf}

   * `secondary_preferred_mode`: If there are replicas in the cluster, they will be used for data reads instead of the master host.

   * `collections`: Data is only transferred from listed collections. All collections are transferred by default.

      {% include [Description for Included collections](../../../../_includes/data-transfer/fields/mongodb/description-included-collections.md) %}

   * `excluded_collections`: Data is transferred from all collections except the specified ones.

{% endlist %}

If a source workload is high (over 10,000 write transactions per second), we recommend that you select these settings to have no more than ten different databases at each endpoint. This will help avoid database connection errors while the transfer is ongoing.

{% note info %}

1. If you use several endpoints, you need to create a separate transfer for each one.
1. As transfers of [timeseries collections]({{ mg.docs.comd }}/core/timeseries-collections/) are not supported, you should exclude these collections.

{% endnote %}


## Configuring the data target {#supported-targets}

Configure one of the supported data targets:

* [{{ MG }}](../target/mongodb.md).
* [{{ objstorage-full-name }}](../target/object-storage.md).

For a complete list of supported sources and targets in {{ data-transfer-full-name }}, see [Available Transfers](../../../transfer-matrix.md).

After configuring the data source and target, [create and start the transfer](../../transfer.md#create).

## Operations with the database during transfer {#db-actions}

{% include [work with db](../../../../_includes/data-transfer/endpoints/sources/mongo-work-with-db.md) %}

## Troubleshooting data transfer issues {#troubleshooting}

Known issues when using a {{ MG }} endpoint:

* [Collection key size exceeds 5 MB](#string-size).
* [Collection object size exceeds 16 MB](#object-size).
* [No tables found](#no-tables).
* [Error when transferring a sharded cluster](#sharded).
* [Error when transferring timeseries collections](#timeseries).
* [Unable to recognize an external cluster IP address or FQDN](#cluster-config-issue).
