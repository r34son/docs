# Access management in {{ objstorage-name }}

In this section, you will learn:

* [Which resources you can assign a role for](#resources).
* [Which roles exist in the service](#roles-list).

{% include [about-access-management](../../_includes/iam/about-access-management.md) %}

## Which resources you can assign a role for {#resources}

Using the {{ yandex-cloud }} console or the YC CLI, you can assign a role for a [cloud](../../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md#cloud), a [folder](../../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md#folder), or an individual bucket. These assigned roles will also apply to nested resources.

For information about managing access to buckets and objects, see [{#T}](../concepts/acl.md).
