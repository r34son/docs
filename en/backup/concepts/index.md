# {{ backup-full-name }} overview

{{ backup-full-name }} is a service for creating backups and restoring {{ yandex-cloud }} resources and their data. Backup and recovery is available for [{{ compute-name }} VMs](../../compute/concepts/vm.md) with [supported operating systems](vm-connection.md#os).

VM backups are application-consistent: they save not only the data stored on disks but also the data already submitted but not yet fully written. This allows you to resume applications that were running at the time of creating a backup directly after recovering a VM. This is important for VMs forming a part of data storage systems, e.g., those hosting a DBMS.

{{ backup-name }} can create [full and incremental backups](backup.md#types). A full backup stores the whole VM data: recovery takes place faster than from an incremental backup, yet such backups take up more storage space and take longer to be created. An incremental backup only stores data that is different from the previous backup, it is created faster and takes up less space. However, recovery from an incremental backup takes longer than from a full one. If you know your VM to have changed a lot since the previous backup, it is better to make a full backup.

With {{ backup-name }}, you can also restore individual files and directories from a backup to any VM connected to the service. For more information, see [File-by-file recovery](backup.md#file-by-file).

To enable backups for your VM, you need to connect it to the service and configure it. For more information, see [{#T}](vm-connection.md).

Once you have connected your instance to {{ backup-name }} and set it up, you need to link it to a [backup policy](policy.md) that is,Â to a {{ backup-name }} resource. The policy includes settings for creating and storing backups. You can link your instances to default policies or create custom policies.

The service has two types of restrictions: [quotas and limits](limits.md).

## Comparison with disk snapshots in {{ compute-name }} {#snapshot-comparison}

| | Disk snapshots in {{ compute-name }} | {{ backup-name }} |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Granularity** | Disk | VMs with all disks.<br>We may also add support for VM application backups. |
| **Disk types** | Network SSD and HDD | Any:<br>Network SSD and HDD,<br>non-replicated disks,<br>and local disks on [dedicated hosts](../../compute/concepts/dedicated-host.md) |
| **Application awareness** | No | To be implemented |
| **Pricing** | Per disk | Per VM |


## Service activation and backup provider {#providers}

{{ backup-name }} is enabled by a _backup provider_. Currently, the service only has one provider available: Cyberprotect.

If you got access to {{ backup-name }}, to get started, you need to activate the service, that is, to connect to a backup provider. You can activate the service directly on its page in the management console (see the [getting started tutorial](../quickstart.md)) or [connect](vm-connection.md) your first VM to {{ backup-name }}: the service will activate automatically in this case.

The minimum folder role required for activating the service is `backup.editor` (see the [role description](../security/index.md#backup-editor)).
