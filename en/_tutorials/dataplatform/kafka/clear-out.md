Delete the resources you no longer need to avoid paying for them:

* [Delete the {{ mkf-name }} cluster](../../../managed-kafka/operations/cluster-delete.md).
* [Delete the virtual machine](../../../compute/operations/vm-control/vm-delete.md).
* If you reserved public static IP addresses, release and [delete them](../../../vpc/operations/address-delete.md).
