# Comparing load test results

In this use case, you will set up a load testing environment, run the tests, and compare the results of the load tests.
The use case uses the [Pandora](../../load-testing/concepts/load-generator.md#pandora) [load generator](../../load-testing/concepts/load-generator.md) and a simple web service as the test target.

To perform load testing and compare test results:
1. [Prepare your cloud](#before-begin).
1. [Prepare your infrastructure](#infrastructure-prepare).
1. [Prepare a test target](#target-prepare).
1. [Create an agent](#create-agent).
1. [Prepare a file with test data](#test-file).
1. [Run a test](#run-test).
1. [Run the same test several times](#rerun-test).
1. [Compare the results](#compare-results).

If you no longer need the resources you created, [delete them](#clear-out).

## Prepare your cloud {#before-begin}

{% include [before-you-begin](../_tutorials_includes/before-you-begin.md) %}

### Required paid resources {#paid-resources}

If the [agent](../../load-testing/concepts/agent.md) is hosted on {{ yandex-cloud }}, a fee is charged for computing resources (see [{{ compute-full-name }} pricing](../../compute/pricing.md)).

At the [Preview](../../overview/concepts/launch-stages.md) stage, using {{ load-testing-name }} is free of charge.

## Prepare the infrastructure {#infrastructure-prepare}

### Create a service account {#sa-create}

{% include [sa-create](../../_includes/load-testing/sa-create.md) %}

### Configure a network {#network-setup}

[Create and configure a NAT gateway](../../vpc/operations/create-nat-gateway.md) in the subnet where your test target and the agent will be placed. Thus, the agent will have access to {{ load-testing-name }}.

### Configure security groups {#security-group-setup}

1. Set up the test agent's security group:

   {% include [security-groups-agent](../../_includes/load-testing/security-groups-agent.md) %}

1. Set up the test target's security group:

   {% include [security-groups-target](../../_includes/load-testing/security-groups-target.md) %}

## Prepare a test target {#target-prepare}

To prepare a test target:

1. [Create a VM](../../compute/operations/vm-create/create-linux-vm.md) from a public Linux image:
   1. Specify `load-target` as the name.
   1. Specify, e.g., `ycuser` as the username.
   1. Specify the `load-target-sg` security group in the network settings section.

1. [Connect](../../compute/operations/vm-connect/ssh.md) to the VM via SSH by running the command:
   ```bash
   	ssh ycuser@<VM_public_IP_address>
   ```

1. Create a web service file by running:
   ```bash
   	mkdir app
   	cd app
   	nano app.py
   ```

1. Paste the following code into the web service file:
   ```bash
   	from flask import Flask, make_response
   	from flask_cors import CORS
   	import os

   	app = Flask(__name__)
   	CORS(app)

   	@app.route('/')
   	def index():
   		 res = make_response({"message":"Root URL"}, status_code=200)
   		 return res

   	@app.route('/test')
   	def get_test():
   		 res = make_response({"message":"Get test URL"}, status_code=200)
   		 return res

   	# Run application
   	if __name__ == '__main__':
   		 app.run(host='0.0.0.0', debug=False, port=443)	
   ```
1. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   	pip install flask flask-cors
   ```

1. Run the service:
   ```bash
   	python3 app.py
   ```

   The service will expect requests on port 443. Make sure the port is open and configured for HTTPS requests.

## Create a test agent {#create-agent}

{% include [create-agent](../../_includes/load-testing/create-agent.md) %}

## Prepare a file with test data {#test-file}

1. Generate payloads in [URI](../../load-testing/concepts/payloads/uri.md) format:
   ```text
   [Host: <test_target_internal_IP_address>]
   [Connection: Close]
   / index
   /test?param1=1&param2=2 get_test
   ```

   Please note that the `Connection: Close` header means each connection is terminated after making a request. This mode is heavier on the application and load generator. If you do not need to close connections, set `Keep-Alive`.

   There are also two requests tagged `index` and `get_test`. The load generator will repeat them within a given [load profile](../../load-testing/concepts/load-profile.md).

1. Save the payloads to a file named `data.uri`.

## Run a test {#run-test}

1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), select **{{ ui-key.yacloud.iam.folder.dashboard.label_load-testing }}**.
1. In the left-hand panel, select ![image](../../_assets/load-testing/test.svg) **{{ ui-key.yacloud.load-testing.label_tests-list }}**. Click **{{ ui-key.yacloud.load-testing.button_create-test }}**.
1. In the **{{ ui-key.yacloud.load-testing.label_agents-list }}** parameter, select `agent-008`.
1. Under **Attached files**, click **Select files** and select the `data.uri` file you saved earlier.
1. Under **{{ ui-key.yacloud.load-testing.label_test-settings }}**, select a configuration method: **{{ ui-key.yacloud.load-testing.label_settings-type-form }}** or **{{ ui-key.yacloud.load-testing.label_settings-type-config }}**.
1. Depending on the selected method, specify the test parameters:

   {% list tabs %}

   - {{ ui-key.yacloud.load-testing.label_settings-type-form }}

      1. In the **{{ ui-key.yacloud.load-testing.field_load-generator }}** field, select **PANDORA**.
      1. In the **{{ ui-key.yacloud.load-testing.field_target-address }}** field, specify the internal IP address of the service being tested.
      1. In the **{{ ui-key.yacloud.load-testing.field_target-port }}** field, set `443` (default HTTPS port).
          Allow using a secure connection.
      1. In the **Testing threads** field, specify `5000`.

         This means that the load generator can simultaneously process 5,000 operations: create 5,000 connections or wait for 5,000 responses from the service at the same time.

         {% note tip %}

         For most tests, 1,000 to 10,000 [threads](../../load-testing/concepts/testing-stream.md) are enough.

         Using a larger number of testing threads requires more resources of the [VM](../../compute/concepts/vm.md) the agent is running on. {{ compute-name }} also has a limit of 50,000 concurrent connections to a VM.

         {% endnote %}

      1. In the **Load type** menu, select `RPS`.
      1. Click ![image](../../_assets/plus-sign.svg) **Load profile** and enter the following description:
         * **Profile 1**: `Step`
         * **From**: `1000`
         * **To**: `5000`
         * **Step**: `1000`
         * **Duration**: `120s`

         This is an instruction for the generator to increase the load from 1,000 to 5,000 requests per second in steps of 1,000 requests, 120 seconds each.
      1. In the **Request type** field, select `URI`.
      1. In the **{{ ui-key.yacloud.load-testing.test-data-section }}** field, select **Attached file**.
      1. In the **Autostop** menu, click ![image](../../_assets/plus-sign.svg) **Autostop** and enter the following description:
         * **Autostop type 1**: `QUANTILE`
         * **Quantile**: `75`
         * **Response time limit**: `100ms`
         * **Window duration**: `10s`

         This criterion stops the test if the 75th percentile exceeds 100 milliseconds for 10 seconds (for 10 seconds, the processing time of 25% of queries exceeds 100 milliseconds).
      1. Specify one more [autostop](../../load-testing/concepts/auto-stop.md):
         * **Autostop type 2**: `INSTANCES`
         * **Limit**: `90%`
         * **Window duration**: `60s`

         This criterion will stop the test if over 90% of the testing threads are busy for 60 seconds.

         As load increases, the system being tested will start to degrade at some point. Subsequent load increases will result in either an increased response time or an increased error rate. To avoid significantly increasing the test time, make sure to set **Autostop** as a termination criterion for these tests.
      1. Under **{{ ui-key.yacloud.load-testing.meta-section }}**, specify the name, description, and number of the test version. This will make the report easier to read.

   - {{ ui-key.yacloud.load-testing.label_settings-type-config }}

      1. In the configuration input field, specify the test thread settings in `yaml` format:

         ```yaml
         pandora:
            enabled: true
            package: yandextank.plugins.Pandora

                  result:
                  type: phout
                  destination: ./phout.log
                  rps:

                                       # exceeds 100 milliseconds for 10 seconds (for 10 seconds,
                                       # the processing time of 25% of queries exceeds 100 milliseconds).
            - instances(90%,60s)  # End test if 90% of test threads
                                    # are busy for 60 seconds.
         core: {}
         uploader:

            ver: '0.5.5'
            api_address: loadtesting.{{ api-host }}:443
         ```

         As load increases, the system being tested will start to degrade at some point. Subsequent load increases will result in either an increased response time or an increased error rate. To avoid significantly increasing the test time, make sure to set **Autostop** as a termination criterion for these tests.

         {% note tip %}

         View a [sample configuration file](../../load-testing/concepts/testing-stream.md#config_example). You can also find sample configuration files in existing tests.

         {% endnote %}

   {% endlist %}

1. Click **{{ ui-key.yacloud.common.create }}**.

Afterwards, the configuration will be verified, and the agent will start loading the service being tested.

## Repeat the test {#rerun-test}

1. When the test is complete, click ![image](../../_assets/load-testing/restart.svg) **{{ ui-key.yacloud.load-testing.restart }}** at the top right.
1. On the test creation page that opens, upload the same `data.uri` file that you used to create the test.
1. Click **{{ ui-key.yacloud.common.create }}**.

Repeat these steps several times to get several completed tests.

## Compare the results {#compare-results}

To compare the results:

1. In the left-hand panel, select ![image](../../_assets/load-testing/test.svg) **{{ ui-key.yacloud.load-testing.label_tests-list }}**, and in the test table, select the completed tests you want to compare.
1. At the bottom of the pop-up panel, click **{{ ui-key.yacloud.load-testing.button_comparison-test-add }}**.
1. In the left-hand panel, select ![image](../../_assets/load-testing/compare.svg) **{{ ui-key.yacloud.load-testing.label_tests-comparison-section-title }}** and view the combined charts of the load test results.
1. To compare results for a specific request, such as `get_test`, select the required request from the **Case** drop-down list at the top of the page.
1. You can find a table with comparison results on the **{{ ui-key.yacloud.load-testing.label_tables }}** page.

## How to delete the resources you created {#clear-out}

To stop paying for the resources created, just [delete the agent](../../compute/operations/vm-control/vm-delete.md).
