# Cloud infrastructure segmentation with Check Point Next-Generation Firewall

This guide describes how to deploy a secure network infrastructure based on Check Point Next-Generation Firewall solution. The infrastructure comprises three segments, each hosting an isolated set of resources grouped by function. For example, the dedicated [DMZ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMZ_(computing)) segment is where public-facing services are placed and the MGMT segment hosts resources used to manage the cloud infrastructure. The segments communicate with each other via a virtual [Check Point](https://www.checkpoint.com/quantum/next-generation-firewall/) [Next-Generation Firewall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next-generation_firewall), which provides end-to-end protection and traffic control across the segments.

If you need to ensure NGFW fault tolerance and high availability of deployed applications, use [this recommended solution](../../tutorials/routing/high-accessible-dmz.md).

The solution has the following basic segments (folders):

* The **public** folder contains the internet-facing resources.
* The **mgmt** folder is used to manage the cloud infrastructure and host internal resources. It includes VMs for infrastructure protection and network segmentation into security zones (fw), a VM of the centralized firewall management server (mgmt-server), and a VM with [WireGuard VPN](https://www.wireguard.com/) configured for secure access to the management segment over a VPN (jump-vm).
* The **dmz** folder enables you to publish applications with public access from the internet.

For more information, see the [project repository](https://github.com/yandex-cloud-examples/yc-network-segmentation-with-checkpoint).

To deploy a secure network infrastructure based on Check Point Next-Generation Firewall:

1. [Prepare your cloud](#prepare-cloud).
1. [Prepare the environment](#prepare-environment).
1. [Deploy your resources](#create-resources).
1. [Configure the firewall gateway](#configure-gateway).
1. [Test the solution](#test-functionality).
1. [Requirements for production deployment](#deployment-requirements).

If you no longer need the resources you created, [delete them](#clear-out).

### Next-Generation Firewall {#next-generation-firewall}

[{{ marketplace-full-name }}](/marketplace?categories=security) offers multiple NGFW solutions. This scenario uses the [Check Point CloudGuard IaaS](/marketplace?publishers=f2evobrhpbdrcue7s9l5&tab=software) solution. Its features include:
* Firewall, NAT, IPS, antivirus, and anti-bot protect services.
* Application layer granular traffic control, session logging.
* Centralized security management with Check Point Security Management.
* This example uses the basic access control and NAT policies for the Check Point solution.

Yandex Cloud Marketplace offers PAYG and BYOL licensing for Check Point CloudGuard IaaS. This example uses the BYOL option with a 15-day trial:
* NGFW VM [Check Point CloudGuard IaaS - Firewall & Threat Prevention BYOL](/marketplace/products/checkpoint/cloudguard-iaas-firewall-tp-byol-m).
* Management server VM [Check Point CloudGuard IaaS - Security Management BYOL](/marketplace/products/checkpoint/cloudguard-iaas-security-management-byol-m) for NGFW management.

We recommend the following options for production use:
* NGFW [Check Point CloudGuard IaaS - Firewall & Threat Prevention PAYG](/marketplace/products/checkpoint/cloudguard-iaas-firewall-tp-payg-m).
* You need a separate license for the Check Point CloudGuard IaaS - Security Management management server. Alternatively, you can use your on-premise management server.

## Prepare your cloud {#prepare-cloud}

{% include [before-you-begin](../../_tutorials/_tutorials_includes/before-you-begin.md) %}


### Required paid resources {#paid-resources}

The infrastructure support cost includes:

* Fee for continuously running VMs (see [{{ compute-full-name }} pricing](../../compute/pricing.md)).
* Fee for using public IP addresses and outgoing traffic (see [{{ vpc-full-name }} pricing](../../vpc/pricing.md)).


### Required quotas {#required-quotes}

{% note warning %}

The tutorial involves deploying a resource-intensive infrastructure.

{% endnote %}

Make sure your cloud has sufficient [quotas](../../overview/concepts/quotas-limits.md) not being used by resources for other jobs.

{% cut "Amount of resources used by the tutorial" %}

| Resource | Amount |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Folders | 3 |
| Virtual machines | 4 |
| VM instance vCPUs | 12 |
| VM instance RAM | 20 GB |
| Disks | 4 |
| SSD size | 240 GB |
| HDD size | 20 GB |
| Cloud networks | 3 |
| Subnets | 3 |
| Route tables | 2 |
| Security groups | 5 |
| Static public IP addresses | 2 |
| Static routes | 3 |

{% endcut %}

## Prepare the environment {#prepare-environment}

The tutorial uses Windows software and the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux) (WSL).
The infrastructure is deployed using [{{ TF }}](https://www.terraform.io/).

### Configure WSL {#setup-wsl}

1. Check if WSL is installed on your PC. To do this, run the following command in the CLI terminal:

   ```bash
   wsl -l
   ```

   If WSL is installed, the terminal will display a list of available distributions, for example:

   ```bash
   Windows Subsystem for Linux Distributions:
   docker-desktop (Default)
   docker-desktop-data
   Ubuntu
   ```

1. If WSL is not installed, [install](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) it and repeat the previous step.
1. In addition, you can install on WSL a familiar Linux distribution, e.g., [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-on-wsl2-on-windows-11-with-gui-support#1-overview).

1. To make the installed distribution the default system, run:

   ```bash
   wsl --setdefault ubuntu
   ```

1. To switch the terminal to the Linux subsystem operation mode, run:

   ```bash
   wsl ~
   ```

{% note info %}

All the steps described below are completed in the Linux terminal.

## Configure the firewall gateway {#configure-gateway}

This guide describes how to configure firewalls with basic access control and NAT policies required for performance testing but insufficient for [production deployment](#deployment-requirements).

Learn more about Check Point capabilities and configuration with our free course, [A Deep Dive into Network Security](https://cloud.yandex.ru/training/network-security).

### Connect to the control segment via a VPN {#connect-via-vpn}

After deploying the infrastructure, the `mgmt` folder will contain a VM named `jump-vm` based on an Ubuntu image with the [WireGuard VPN](https://www.wireguard.com/) configured for a secure connection. Set up a VPN tunnel to the `jump-vm` on your PC to access the `mgmt`, `dmz`, and `public` segment subnets.

To set up the VPN tunnel:

1. Get the username in the Linux subsystem:

   ```bash
   whoami
   ```

1. [Install](https://download.wireguard.com/windows-client/wireguard-installer.exe) WireGuard on your PC.
1. Open WireGuard and click **Add Tunnel**.
1. In the dialog box that opens, select the `jump-vm-wg.conf` file in the `yc-network-segmentation-with-checkpoint` directory.
   To find the directory created in a Linux subsystem, e.g., Ubuntu, type the file path in the dialog box address bar:

   ```bash
   \\wsl$\Ubuntu\home\<Ubuntu_username>\yc-network-segmentation-with-checkpoint
   ```

   Where `<Ubuntu_username>` is the name of the current Linux distribution user.

1. Click **Activate** to activate the tunnel.
1. Check network connectivity with the management server via the WireGuard VPN tunnel by running the following command in the terminal:

   ```bash
   ping 192.168.1.100
   ```

   {% note warning %}

   If the packets fail to reach the management server, make sure that the `mgmt-jump-vm-sg` [security group](../../vpc/concepts/security-groups.md) rules for incoming traffic have your PC's external IP address specified.

   {% endnote %}

### Run SmartConsole {#setup-smartconsole}

To manage and set up the [Check Point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Check_Point) solution, install and run the SmartConsole GUI client:

1. Connect to the NGFW management server by opening `https://192.168.1.100` in your browser.

### Set up a static NAT table {#setup-static-nat}

Destination NAT routes user requests to the application's web server in the DMZ segment.

It will translate the destination IP address to the web server IP and the destination port to TCP port 8080 in the headers of packets with user requests sent to a DMZ application.

To set up the NAT tables of the FW gateway:

1. Go to the **NAT** subsection of the **Access Control** section.
1. In the rule table menu and select **Add rule to top**.
1. In a new line:
   * In the **Original Destination** column, select the `FW-public-IP` object.
   * In the **Original Services** column, select the `http` object.
   * In the **Translated Destination** column, select the `dmz-web-server` object.
   * In the **Translated Services** column, select the `TCP_8080` object.

   The NAT table will display this rule:

   | No | Original Source | Original Destination | Original Services | Translated Source | Translated Destination | Translated Services | Install On |
   | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
   | 1 | Any | FW-public-IP | http | Original | dmz-web-server | TCP_8080 | Policy Targets (All gateways) |

### Apply the security policy rules {#apply-policies}

1. Click **Install Policy** at the top left of the screen.
1. In the dialog box that opens, click **Publish & Install**.
1. In the next dialog, click **Install** and wait for the process to finish.

## Test the solution {#test-functionality}

1. To find out the public IP address of the firewall, run the following command in the terminal:

   ```bash
   terraform output fw_public_ip_address
   ```

1. Make sure the network infrastructure can be accessed from the outside by opening the following address in the browser:

   ```bash
   http://<FW_public_ip_address>
   ```
   If the system is accessible from the outside, the `Welcome to nginx!` page should open.

1. Make sure the firewall security policy rules that allow traffic are active. To do this, go to the `yc-network-segmentation-with-checkpoint` directory and connect to the DMZ VM over SSH:

   ```bash
   cd ~/yc-network-segmentation-with-checkpoint
   ssh -i pt_key.pem admin@<Internal_ip_address_of_VM_in_DMZ_segment>
   ```

1. To check that there is access from the VM in the DMZ segment to a public resource on the internet, run this command:

   ```bash
   ping ya.ru
   ```

   The command should be executed according to the `ping from dmz to internet` rule that allows traffic.

1. Make sure the security policy rules that prohibit traffic are applied.
   To check that the `jump VM` in the `mgmt` segment cannot be accessed from the `dmz` segment, run this command:

   ```bash
   ping 192.168.1.101
   ```

   The command should fail according to the `Cleanup rule` that prohibits traffic.

1. In SmartConsole, open the `LOGS & MONITOR` section; in the `Logs` tab, find the entries made during testing to see which security rules and actions were applied to the traffic.

## Requirements for production deployment {#deployment-requirements}

* If you need to ensure NGFW fault tolerance and high availability of deployed applications, use [this recommended solution](../../tutorials/routing/high-accessible-dmz.md).
* Make sure to change the passwords sent in the `check-init...yaml` files via the metadata service:
   * SIC password for connecting the firewall and the firewall management server.
   * Check Point SmartConsole password.
   * Admin user password for the firewall management server. You can change this password in Gaia Portal.
* Save the `pt_key.pem` private SSH key to a secure location or recreate it separately from {{ TF }}.
* Delete the public IP address of the jump VM if you do not plan on using it.
* If you plan to use the jump VM for connecting to the management segment with WireGuard VPN, change the WireGuard keys in the jump VM and admin workstation.
* Set up access control and NAT policies for your installation in the Check Point NGFW.
* In security groups within segments, set up the required rules for deployed applications.
* Do not assign public IP addresses to the VMs in those segments where the Check Point NGFW routing tables are used. The only exception is the MGMT segment where routing tables do not use the `0.0.0.0/0 `default route.
* Select your preferred Check Point CloudGuard IaaS license and image (see [Next-Generation Firewall](#next-generation-firewall)).

## How to delete the resources you created {#clear-out}

To stop paying for the resources you created, run this command:

```bash
terraform destroy
```
{{ TF }} will **permanently** delete all the resources: networks, subnets, VMs, folders, etc.

As the resources you created reside in folders, to delete them all faster you can delete all the folders using the {{ yandex-cloud }} console and then delete the `terraform.tfstate` file from the `yc-network-segmentation-with-checkpoint` directory on your PC.
