# Installing a Cisco CSR 1000v virtual router

In {{ yandex-cloud }}, you can deploy a virtual router called Cisco Cloud Services Router (CSR) 1000v, based on a ready-to-use VM image.

To install the CSR 1000v and configure SSH access to it:

1. [Prepare your cloud](#before-you-begin).
1. [Create an SSH key pair](#create-ssh-keys).
1. [Create a VM with a Cisco Cloud Services Router](#create-router).
1. [Set the host name for the router](#hostname).
1. [Create a user with the administrative rights](#create-user).
1. [Configure authentication using SSH keys](#enable-ssh).
1. [Check the SSH connection to the router](#test-ssh).

If you no longer need the resources you created, [delete them](#clear-out).

## Getting started {#before-you-begin}

{% include [before-you-begin](../_tutorials_includes/before-you-begin.md) %}


### Required paid resources {#paid-resources}

{% note alert %}

If using a Cisco CSR 1000v image without a license, router throughput is limited to 100 Kbps. To remove this limit, [install a license](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/routers/csr1000/software/configuration/b_CSR1000v_Configuration_Guide/b_CSR1000v_Configuration_Guide_chapter_01000.html).

{% endnote %}

The cost of using a virtual router includes:

* Fee for a disk and a continuously running VM (see [{{ compute-full-name }} pricing](../../compute/pricing.md)).
* Fee for using a dynamic or static public IP (see [{{ vpc-full-name }} pricing](../../vpc/pricing.md#prices-public-ip)).


## Create an SSH key pair {#create-ssh-keys}

{% include [vm-ssh-rsa-key](../../_includes/vm-ssh-rsa-key.md) %}

{% note warning %}

Save the private key in a secure location, as you will not be able to connect to the VM without it.

{% endnote %}

## Create a VM with a Cisco Cloud Services Router {#create-router}

{% list tabs group=instructions %}

- Management console {#console}

   1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), select a folder where you want to create a VM with Cisco Cloud Services Router.
   1. Click **{{ ui-key.yacloud.iam.folder.dashboard.button_add }}** and select the **{{ ui-key.yacloud.iam.folder.dashboard.value_compute }}** option.
   1. Enter a name for the VM, e.g., `cisco-router`.
   1. Select an [availability zone](../../overview/concepts/geo-scope.md) to place your VM in. If you do not know which availability zone you need, leave the default one.
   1. Under **{{ ui-key.yacloud.compute.instances.create.section_image }}**, go to the **{{ ui-key.yacloud.compute.instances.create.image_value_marketplace }}** tab and select the [Cisco CSR](/marketplace/products/yc/cisco-csr).
   1. Under **{{ ui-key.yacloud.compute.instances.create.section_platform }}**:
      * Choose a VM [platform](../../compute/concepts/vm-platforms.md).
      * Specify the required number of vCPUs and the amount of RAM:
         * **{{ ui-key.yacloud.component.compute.resources.field_platform }}**: `Intel Ice Lake`
         * **{{ ui-key.yacloud.component.compute.resources.field_cores }}**: `2`
         * **{{ ui-key.yacloud.component.compute.resources.field_core-fraction }}**: `100%`
         * **{{ ui-key.yacloud.component.compute.resources.field_memory }}**: `4 {{ ui-key.yacloud.common.units.label_gigabyte }}`
   1. Under **{{ ui-key.yacloud.compute.instances.create.section_network }}**, select the network and subnet to connect the VM to. If there are no networks available, create one:
      1. Select ![image](../../_assets/console-icons/plus.svg) **{{ ui-key.yacloud.component.vpc.network-select.button_create-network }}**.
      1. In the window that opens, specify the network name and the folder to host the VM.
      1. (Optional) To automatically create subnets, select the **{{ ui-key.yacloud.component.vpc.create-network-dialog.field_is-default }}** option.
      1. Click **{{ ui-key.yacloud.component.vpc.create-network-dialog.button_create }}**.

         Each network must have at least one subnet. If there is no subnet available, create one by selecting ![image](../../_assets/console-icons/plus.svg) **{{ ui-key.yacloud.component.vpc.network-select.button_create-subnetwork }}**.
      1. Under **{{ ui-key.yacloud.component.compute.network-select.field_external }}**, keep `{{ ui-key.yacloud.component.compute.network-select.switch_auto }}` to assign your VM a random external IP address from the {{ yandex-cloud }} pool, or select a static address from the list if you reserved one in advance.
   1. Under **{{ ui-key.yacloud.compute.instances.create.section_access }}**, specify the information required to access the instance:
      * Enter the username in the **{{ ui-key.yacloud.compute.instances.create.field_user }}** field.
      * In the **{{ ui-key.yacloud.compute.instances.create.field_key }}** field, paste the contents of the [previously generated](#create-ssh-keys) public key file.
   1. In the **{{ ui-key.yacloud.compute.instances.create.field_access-advanced }}** field, select **{{ ui-key.yacloud.compute.instances.create.field_serial-port-enable }}**.
   1. Click **{{ ui-key.yacloud.compute.instances.create.button_create }}**.

   It may take a few minutes to create the VM. When the VM status changes to `RUNNING`, you can use the serial console.

{% endlist %}

## Set the host name for the router {#hostname}

{% list tabs group=instructions %}

- Management console {#console}

   1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), select the folder containing your VM.
   1. Select **{{ ui-key.yacloud.iam.folder.dashboard.label_compute }}**.
   1. Select `cisco-router` from the VM list.
   1. Go to the ![image](../../_assets/console-icons/terminal.svg) **{{ ui-key.yacloud.compute.instance.switch_console }}** tab and click **{{ ui-key.yacloud.compute.instance.console.connect }}**.
   1. Wait for the operating system to start up completely.
   1. Run the `enable` command to switch to privileged mode:

      ```text
      cisco-router.{{ region-id }}.internal>enable
      ```

   1. Enter the configuration mode and set the host name for the router:

      ```text
      cisco-router.{{ region-id }}.internal#configure terminal
      Enter configuration commands, one per line. End with CNTL/Z.
      cisco-router.ru-cent(config)#hostname cisco-router
      ```

      Make sure the router name in the command line prompt changes to `cisco-router`.

{% endlist %}

## Create a user with the administrative rights {#create-user}

Create a user with the administrative rights and password authentication disabled:

{% list tabs group=instructions %}

- Management console {#console}

   In the serial console, run this command:

   ```text
   cisco-router(config)#username test-user privilege 15
   ```

{% endlist %}

## Configure authentication using SSH keys {#enable-ssh}

1. If your public SSH key is longer than 72 characters, split it into chunks of 72 characters each. Do it by running this command in your computer terminal:

   ```bash
   fold -bw 72 <path_to_file_with_public key>
   ```

   This will output your public SSH key split into chunks, 72 characters in each.

1. In the serial console, enable access to the VM over SSH:

   ```text
   cisco-router(config)#aaa new-model
   cisco-router(config)#ip ssh server algorithm authentication publickey
   cisco-router(config)#ip ssh pubkey-chain
   ```

1. Create a user named `test-user` and transmit, in the `conf-ssh-pubkey-data` mode, your public SSH key in chunks no longer than 72 characters, beginning with `ssh-rsa` and ending with the username:

   ```text
   cisco-router(conf-ssh-pubkey)#username test-user
   cisco-router(conf-ssh-pubkey-user)#key-string
   cisco-router(conf-ssh-pubkey-data)#<public_key_string>
   ...
   cisco-router(conf-ssh-pubkey-data)#<public_key_string>
   cisco-router(conf-ssh-pubkey-data)#exit
   cisco-router(conf-ssh-pubkey-user)#exit
   cisco-router(conf-ssh-pubkey)#exit
   cisco-router(config)#exit
   ```

1. Make sure that the key is added:

   ```text
   cisco-router#show run | beg ip ssh
   ip ssh pubkey-chain
     username test-user
      key-hash ssh-rsa <key_hash> <username_assigned_this_key>
   !
   !
   ...
   ```

1. Compare the SSH key hash on the router with the key hash on your computer:

   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -E md5 -lf <path_to_file_with_public_key>
   ```

1. In the serial console, enter the password that enables the privileged mode:

   ```text
   cisco-router#configure terminal
   cisco-router(config)#enable secret <password>
   ```

## Check the SSH connection to the router {#test-ssh}

1. Log in to the router via SSH. Do it by running this command in your computer terminal:

   ```bash
   ssh -i <path_to_file_with_private_key> test-user@<public_IP_of_router>
   ```

   If everything is configured correctly, you will log in to the router under `test-user`. If the connection is not established, make sure that the router is configured correctly in the serial console: the `aaa new-model` command was run, the key hashes are the same on your computer and the router, and password authorization for the test user is disabled. If still unable to locate the issue, repeat the previous steps.
1. Enter the `enable` command and password. If everything is configured correctly, you can configure the router.

## How to delete the resources you created {#clear-out}

To stop paying for the resources you created:
* [Delete](../../compute/operations/vm-control/vm-delete.md) the VM.
* [Delete](../../vpc/operations/address-delete.md) the static public IP if you reserved one.
