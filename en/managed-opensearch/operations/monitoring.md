## Monitoring cluster state {#monitoring-cluster}

To view detailed information about the {{ mos-name }} cluster state:

{% list tabs group=instructions %}

- Management console {#console}

   1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), go to the folder page and select **{{ ui-key.yacloud.iam.folder.dashboard.label_managed-opensearch }}**.
   1. Click the cluster name and select the ![image](../../_assets/console-icons/display-pulse.svg) **{{ ui-key.yacloud.mdb.cluster.switch_monitoring }}** tab.

      The page displays the following charts:

      * **Health status**: Shows the cluster's health and technical condition:

         * `0` (red): Cluster is unhealthy or partially functional. At least one of the [primary shards](../concepts/scalability-and-resilience.md) is unavailable. If the cluster responds to queries, the search results will be incomplete.
         * `1` (yellow): Cluster is healthy. There is no access to at least one of the replica shards. The search results in the cluster responses are complete; however, if there are more unavailable shards, cluster performance will be disrupted.
         * `2` (green): Cluster is healthy. All cluster shards are available.

      * **Active shards**: Number of active primary shards and the total number of active shards in the cluster.
      * **Other shards**: Number of inactive shards in each of the following states:

         * `Delayed unassigned`: Host assignment is delayed.
         * `Unassigned`: There is no assigned host.
         * `Relocating`: Moving to another host.
         * `Initializing`: Being initialized.

      * **Nodes**: Number of hosts with the `DATA` [role](../concepts/host-roles.md#data).
      * **Segments**: Number of index segments per host.
      * **Pending tasks**: Number of enqueued tasks.
      * **Indexing rate**: Number of indexing operations per second, per host.
      * **Search rate**: Number of search queries per second, per host.

## Monitoring the state of hosts {#monitoring-hosts}

To view detailed information about the state of individual {{ mos-name }} hosts:

1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), go to the folder page and select **{{ ui-key.yacloud.iam.folder.dashboard.label_managed-opensearch }}**.
1. Click the cluster name and select the ![image](../../_assets/console-icons/cube.svg) **{{ ui-key.yacloud.mdb.cluster.hosts.label_title }}** tab.
1. Select the **{{ ui-key.yacloud.mdb.cluster.hosts.switch_monitoring }}** tab.
1. Select the host from the drop-down list.

This page displays charts showing the load on an individual host in the cluster. Which charts are exactly displayed depends on the host type:

## Monitoring the state of host groups {#monitoring-host-groups}

To view detailed information about the state of a {{ mos-name }} host group:

1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), go to the folder page and select **{{ ui-key.yacloud.iam.folder.dashboard.label_managed-opensearch }}**.

1. Select the host group you need from the drop-down list.

This page displays charts showing the load on the cluster's host group. Which charts are exactly displayed depends on the type of hosts in the group; this is in line with the [charts shown for individual hosts](#monitoring-hosts).


## Alert settings in {{ monitoring-full-name }} {#monitoring-integration}

{% list tabs group=instructions %}

- Management console {#console}

   1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), select the folder with the cluster you want to configure alerts for.
   1. In the list of services, select ![image](../../_assets/console-icons/display-pulse.svg) **{{ ui-key.yacloud.iam.folder.dashboard.label_monitoring }}**.
   1. Under **{{ ui-key.yacloud_monitoring.dashboard.tab.service-dashboards }}**, select:

      * **{{ mos-name }}** to configure cluster alerts.
      * **{{ mos-name }} — Dashboards** to configure alerts for hosts with the `DASHBOARDS` role.
      * **{{ mos-name }} — Data** to configure alerts for hosts with the `DATA` role.
      * **{{ mos-name }} — Manager** to configure alerts for hosts with the `MANAGER` role.

   1. In the chart you need, click ![options](../../_assets/console-icons/ellipsis.svg) and select **{{ ui-key.yacloud.monitoring.button_create-alert }}**.
   1. If the chart shows multiple metrics, select a data query to generate a metric and click **{{ ui-key.yacloud_monitoring.dialog.confirm.button_continue }}**. You can learn more about the query language in the [{{ monitoring-full-name }} documentation](../../monitoring/concepts/querying.md).
   1. Set the `{{ ui-key.yacloud_monitoring.alert.status_alarm }}` and `{{ ui-key.yacloud_monitoring.alert.status_warn }}` thresholds to trigger an alert.
   1. Click **{{ ui-key.yacloud.monitoring.button_create-alert }}**.

{% endlist %}

{% include [other-indicators](../../_includes/mdb/other-indicators.md) %}

The recommended thresholds are as follows:

| Metric | Parameter | Formula | `{{ ui-key.yacloud_monitoring.alert.status_alarm }}` | `{{ ui-key.yacloud_monitoring.alert.status_warn }}` |
|----------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------:|:----------------------:|:---------------------------------:|:---------------------------------:|
| Cluster status | `opensearch_status` | `bottom_last(1)` | `Equal to 0` | `Equal to 1` |
| Number of unassigned shards | `opensearch_unassigned_shards` | `top_last(1)` | `Greater than 0` |                                   |
| Number of relocated shards | `opensearch_relocating_shards` | `top_last(1)` | `Greater than 0` |                                   |
| Number of initialized shards | `opensearch_initializing_shards` | `top_last(1)` | `Greater than 0` |                                   |
| Number of delayed assignment shards | `opensearch_delayed_unassigned_shards` | `top_last(1)` | `Greater than 0` |                                   |
| JVM heap memory used | `opensearch_jvm_mem_heap_used_percent` | `top_last(1)` | Over 90% of host RAM |                                   |
| Storage space used | `opensearch_fs_total_used_percent` | `top_last(1)` | Over 90% of the storage size | Over 85% of the storage size |
| Using the JVM long-lived object pool | `opensearch_jvm_mem_heap_pressure` | `top_last(1)` | Over 90% of host RAM | Over 75% of host RAM |
| Storage space used | `disk.used_bytes` | — | 90% of the storage size | 80% of the storage size |

For the `disk.used_bytes` metric, the `{{ ui-key.yacloud_monitoring.alert.status_alarm }}` and `{{ ui-key.yacloud_monitoring.alert.status_warn }}` thresholds are only set in bytes. For example, the recommended values for a 100 GB disk are as follows:

* `{{ ui-key.yacloud_monitoring.alert.status_alarm }}`: `96,636,764,160` bytes (90%)
* `{{ ui-key.yacloud_monitoring.alert.status_warn }}`: `85,899,345,920` bytes (80%)

You can view the host's current storage size and RAM amount in the [detailed information about the cluster](cluster-list.md#get-cluster). For a complete list of supported metrics, see the [{{ monitoring-name }} documentation](../../monitoring/metrics-ref/index.md#managed-opensearch).


## Cluster state and status {#cluster-health-and-status}

{% include [health-and-status](../../_includes/mdb/monitoring-cluster-health-and-status.md) %}

To view a cluster's state and status:

{% list tabs group=instructions %}

- Management console {#console}

   1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), go to the folder page and select **{{ ui-key.yacloud.iam.folder.dashboard.label_managed-opensearch }}**.
   1. Hover over the indicator in the **{{ ui-key.yacloud.common.availability }}** column in the required cluster row.

- CLI {#cli}

   {% include [cli-install](../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

   {% include [default-catalogue](../../_includes/default-catalogue.md) %}

   To find out the state and status of a cluster, get information about it:

   ```bash
   {{ yc-mdb-os }} cluster get <cluster_name_or_ID>
   ```

   You will see the cluster state in the `health` parameter and the cluster status, in the `status` parameter.

   You can request the cluster name and ID with a [list of clusters in the folder](cluster-list.md#list-clusters).

- API {#api}

   Use the [get](../api-ref/Cluster/get.md) REST API method for the [Cluster](../api-ref/Cluster/index.md) resource or the [ClusterService/Get](../api-ref/grpc/cluster_service.md#Get) gRPC API call and provide the ID of the cluster to delete in the `clusterId` request parameter.

   The cluster health and status will be shown in the `health` and `status` parameters, respectively.
