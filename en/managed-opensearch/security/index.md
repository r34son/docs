# Managing access to {{ mos-name }}


In this section, you will learn:

* [Which resources you can assign a role for](#resources).
* [Which roles exist in the service](#roles-list).
* [Which roles are required](#required-roles) for particular actions.

To use the service, log in to the management console with a [Yandex account](../../iam/concepts/index.md#passport) or [federated account](../../iam/concepts/index.md#saml-federation).

{% include [about-access-management](../../_includes/iam/about-access-management.md) %}

## Which resources you can assign a role for {#resources}

{% include [basic-resources](../../_includes/iam/basic-resources-for-access-control.md) %}

To allow access to {{ mos-name }} service resources (clusters and hosts, cluster backups, and accounts), assign the user the appropriate roles for a folder or cloud hosting the resources.

## Which roles exist in the service {#roles-list}

The chart below shows which roles are available in the service and how they inherit each other's permissions. For example, the `{{ roles-editor }}` role includes all the permissions of `{{ roles-viewer }}`. You can find the description of each role under the chart.

### Primitive roles {#primitive-roles}

{% include [roles-primitive](../../_includes/roles-primitive.md) %}

## Roles required {#required-roles}

To use the service, you need the `{{ roles.mos.editor }}` [role](../../iam/concepts/access-control/roles.md) or higher for the folder where a cluster is created. The `{{ roles.mos.viewer }}` role only enables you to view the cluster list.

You can always assign a role with more permissions. For instance, you can assign `{{ roles.mos.admin }}` instead of `{{ roles.mos.editor }}`.
