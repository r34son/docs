# {{ forms-full-name }} release notes: July 2023

* [Saving attached files to Yandex Disk](#saving-files-disk)
* [Domains under integration conditions for a group of actions](#tld)


## Saving attached files to Yandex Disk {#saving-files-disk}

{% note warning %}

This option is only available for [personal forms](../personal-forms.md).

{% endnote %}

Added a setting that allows you to save attached files from user responses to the form owner's Yandex Disk. To enable this setting, on the page for editing forms, go to **Settings** â†’ **Advanced** and select **Save attached files from responses to Yandex Disk**.

This will create the `Yandex.Forms` folder on the form owner's Yandex Disk, where files from new user responses will be saved. Files received before you enabled this setting will continue to be stored in {{ forms-name }} for a [limited time](../answers.md#files).



## Domains under integration conditions for a group of actions {#tld}

[Integrations](../notifications.md#section_xlw_rjc_tbb) now contain a new condition for executing an action group: `tld`, top-level domain compliance. You can choose from the following values:

* ru
* by
* com
* tr
* kz
* ua
