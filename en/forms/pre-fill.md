# Configuring pre-filling of forms

You can configure a form so that when it is opened, specified values are automatically inserted into fields or certain responses are pre-selected.

You can use pre-filling:

- To suggest to the user the responses that you think are preferable or most likely.

- To supply auxiliary or technical parameters to [the form's hidden fields](hidden-query.md) (for example, for gathering statistics).


To set a field value or select a response option, send the [question ID](question-id.md) and the  response value to the form using [GET parameters in the form URL](get-params.md)
