# Procedure for providing technical support



{{ yandex-cloud }} provides technical support under different service plans. You can choose the one that best suits you. The cost of paid technical support plans includes two components: fixed and supplemental. The supplemental part is calculated as a percentage of the cost of resources consumed during the month. For more information about the plans, see the [Pricing policy](pricing.md).


## Contacting support {#response-time}



Depending on your service plan, you can contact technical support using one of these methods:

{% include [support-channels](../_includes/support/channels.md) %}

The expected support specialist response time is shown in the table below. A dash in a table cell means the corresponding communication channel is not available for the selected service plan.

| Channel | Basic | Business | Premium |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                           | For personal and research projects | For professional projects | For business projects with stringent fault tolerance requirements. |
| Request to Support Center | Normal: 24 hours<br>Increase quotas: 30 minutes | Normal: 4 hours<br>Critical: 30 minutes<br>Increase quotas: 30 minutes | Normal: 2 hours<br>Critical: 15 minutes<br>Increase quotas: 30 minutes |
| Chat | - | 5 minutes | 5 minutes, a messenger of your choice |

Only {{ yandex-cloud }} [organization members](../organization/concepts/membership.md) can send requests to support. [Make sure](./support-center.md#before-you-begin) you are making a request on behalf of the right organization. If you have an issue with your infrastructure's production environment, specify _{{ ui-key.support-center.tickets.common.label_ticket-type-critical }}_ for request type.

Regardless of your service plan, you can request the following from technical support:

* [Service logs](request.md#logs) related to your resources and actions in {{ yandex-cloud }}.
* [Your personal data](request.md#personal) stored by Yandex.


## Types of requests to support {#request-types}



The types of requests available depend on the selected plan and are shown in the table below.

{{ yandex-cloud }} technical support engineers don't address the following issues:
* Develop software code.
* Debug your own software.

Technical support includes diagnosing issues in third-party software used in conjunction with the cloud infrastructure and limited assistance in solving the identified problems. Technical support engineers can help you with the installation, basic setup, and diagnostics of the following software:

- [Operating systems](https://cloud.yandex.ru/marketplace?categories=os) on {{ yandex-cloud }} VM instances created from public images provided by {{ yandex-cloud }}.
- Databases and cluster management systems created in:
   - [{{ maf-full-name }}](../managed-airflow)
   - [{{ mkf-full-name }}](../managed-kafka/index.yaml)
   - [{{ mch-full-name }}](../managed-clickhouse/index.yaml)
   - [{{ mes-full-name }}](../managed-elasticsearch/index.yaml)
   - [{{ mgp-full-name }}](../managed-greenplum/index.yaml)

{% include [end-of-life](../_includes/compute/end-of-life.md) %}

If the technical support team cannot resolve your third-party software issue, contact the support service of the software vendor. In some cases, contacting the vendor's support service requires a valid technical support contract with the vendor or its partners.
