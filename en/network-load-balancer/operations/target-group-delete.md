   {% include [default-catalogue](../../_includes/default-catalogue.md) %}

   1. See the description of the CLI delete target group command:

      ```bash
      yc load-balancer target-group delete --help
      ```

      ```bash
      yc load-balancer target-group delete <target_group_name_or_ID>
      ```

      You can get the target group ID and name with a [list of target groups in the folder](target-group-list.md#list).

   To delete a target group created with {{ TF }}:
   1. Open the {{ TF }} configuration file and delete the fragment with the target group description.

      ```hcl
      resource "yandex_lb_target_group" "foo" {
        name      = "<target_group_name>"
        target {
          subnet_id = "<subnet_ID>"
          address   = "<resource_internal_IP_address>"
        }
        target {
          subnet_id = "<subnet_ID>"
          address   = "<resource_2_internal_IP_address>"
        }
      }
      ```

   1. Make sure the settings are correct.

      {% include [terraform-validate](../../_includes/mdb/terraform/validate.md) %}

   You can get the target group ID with a [list of target groups in the folder](target-group-list.md#list).
