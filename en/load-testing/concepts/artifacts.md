# Test artifacts

Test artifacts are objects created on an [agent](agent.md) during load testing.

Test artifacts are used to generate [reports](reports.md).

## Accessing the artifacts

To access test artifacts, use one of these options:

* Log in to the test agent [over SSH](../../compute/operations/vm-connect/ssh.md#vm-connect) and proceed to the `/var/lib/ulta/tests` directory.
* [Save the test artifacts to Object Storage](../operations/save-artifacts.md).
